    abstract = "{As the number of seismic sensors grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements in automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method called “PhaseNet” that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with sufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals and noise as output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in the probability distributions provide accurate arrival times for both P and S waves. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by analyst-labelled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The data set we use contains more than 700 000 waveform samples extracted from over 30 yr of earthquake recordings. We demonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate than existing methods when applied to the waveforms of known earthquakes, which has the potential to increase the number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available. This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity models.}",

Despite great advances in seismic data collection, the usage of seismic arrival times is still insufficient because of the overload manual picking tasks for human experts. In this work we employ a deep-learning method (PickNet) to automatically pick much more P and S wave arrival times of local earthquakes with a picking accuracy close to that by human experts, which can be used directly to determine seismic tomography. A large number of high-quality seismic arrival times obtained with the deep-learning model may contribute greatly to improve our understanding of the Earth's interior structure.},

abstract = {The increasing volume of seismic data from long-term continuous monitoring motivates the development of algorithms based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for faster and more reliable phase detection and picking. However, many less studied regions lack a significant amount of labeled events needed for traditional CNN approaches. In this paper, we present a CNN-based Phase-Identification Classifier (CPIC) designed for phase detection and picking on small to medium sized training datasets. When trained on 30,146 labeled phases and applied to one-month of continuous recordings during the aftershock sequences of the 2008 MW 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan, China, CPIC detects 97.5% of the manually picked phases in the standard catalog and predicts their arrival times with a five-times improvement over the ObsPy AR picker. In addition, unlike other CNN-based approaches that require millions of training samples, when the off-line training set size of CPIC is reduced to only a few thousand training samples the accuracy stays above 95%. The deployment of CPIC takes less than 12 h to pick arrivals in 31-day recordings on 14 stations. In addition to the catalog phases manually picked by analysts, CPIC finds more phases for existing events and new events missed in the catalog. Among those additional detections, some are confirmed by a matched filter method while others require further investigation. Finally, when tested on a small dataset from a different region (Oklahoma, US), CPIC achieves 97% accuracy after fine tuning only the fully connected layer of the model. This result suggests that the CPIC developed in this study can be used to identify and pick P/S arrivals in other regions with no or minimum labeled phases.}

The principal alternative to this approach is pattern recognition, which tests on positive correlation with some known signal patterns.The Sonogram-detector realizes this scheme for single seismogram traces. Sonograms display spectral energy versus time. Suitably scaled, these images display only information which is significant to the detection process. Patterns of known earthquakes and noise signals are defined by means of these images. Event detection is performed by recognizing one of the patterns in the actual sonogram. The overall processing scheme is similar to the visual inspection of seismograms by the human observer.An off-line test installation for detecting local earthquakes proves the expected low false alarm rate, high timing accuracy and good detection probability of the Sonogram-detector.}",

abstract = {Early tsunami and earthquake warning systems need a good Automatic First Arrival Picking (AFAP) subsystem to determine the earthquake arrival time. This subsystem has a time-domain earthquake signal as the input and the arrival time of the primary earthquake wave (P-Wave) as the output. There are several methods of AFAP that are widely used nowadays, one of them is Short Term Average/Long Term Average (STA/LTA) fused with the AR-AIC method. Even though this method is real-time, its performance is still relatively low. With similar characteristics between the seismic signals and image data, utilising deep learning on AFAP can further increase its performance. The seismogram channels can be seen as the image height, and the signal at a certain window can be seen as the image width. Unfortunately, these image data will be considered an imbalanced dataset. In this research, deep learning with time domain and frequency domain are proposed as inputs with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) method. Deep learning is used because of its ability to generalise well on a huge dataset, while SMOTE is used to overcome the imbalanced dataset problem. With this proposed system, the accuracy is 99.3%, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 0.202 seconds, and the maximum execution time is 0.17 seconds with a periodic time of 0.4 seconds. With these results, the AFAP system has good results for estimating the first arrival earthquake time.}
